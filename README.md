After selecting your character and difficulty level, the game will begin.

Controls:
Use the arrow keys to move.

Gameplay: 
The goal of the game is to avoid bugs while collecting gems.  You start with five lives, shown by hearts in the upper right.  Every time you touch a bug, you lose a life and reappear at the start.  You also die if you step onto the water.  If you run out of lives, you get a 'game over' and have to start again.

Enemies:
All bugs are deadly, but pay close attention to how they behave.  Some just trundle along, others stop and start, others wander back and forth.  Some of them will even turn towards you and speed up if they see you on the same row!

Hearts and Gems:
Hearts and gems sometimes appear for a few seconds on a square.  Stepping on the hearts will give you an extra life, while stepping on gems increases your score.  Green gems are worth 200 points, blue gems are worth 500 points, orange gems are worth 1000 points--but be careful!  The orange gems disappear more quickly.  Dying will dock your score by 500 points.  See how high a score you can get!
